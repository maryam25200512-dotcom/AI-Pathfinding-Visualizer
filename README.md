AI Grid Pathfinding Visualizer

A simple Python program to visualize AI pathfinding algorithms on an 8x8 grid with obstacles.

Features

Shows explored nodes

Shows frontier nodes

Shows the final shortest path

Step-by-step visualization of the search process

Algorithms Implemented

Breadth First Search (BFS)

Depth First Search (DFS)

Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

Depth Limited Search (DLS)

Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)

Bidirectional Search

Requirements

Before running, install these Python libraries:

pip install numpy matplotlib

Run via Terminal

Install dependencies:

pip install numpy matplotlib 

Run the program:

python main.py

Choose an algorithm from the menu.

Open Jupyter Notebook and run !pip install numpy matplotlib once.

Copy all your code into one cell, remove if __name__ == "__main__": main(), and add main() at the end.

Run the cell with Shift + Enter.

Enter a number 1–6 to choose the algorithm.

A window will pop up showing the grid and path.

Close the window when done or rerun the cell to try another algorithm.

If the window doesn’t show, add %matplotlib notebook at the top.


Understand shortest path vs explored nodes
